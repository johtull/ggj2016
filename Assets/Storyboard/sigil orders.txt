Each sigil listed is in the order of their make, but the numbers in parenthesis are the order in which they should be revealed in the list.

Each level should have so many sigils needed, in a randomized correct order.


This is an idea of how to progress them to increasing difficulty.
Level 1: First 3 Sigils
Level 2: Sigils 1-5
Level 3: sigils 1-6
Level 4: sigils 1-8
Level 5: all 10

Sigil 1: key (1)

Sigil 2: Auger (3)

Sigil 3: Blade (5)

Sigil 4: Sanguine (2)

Sigil 5: Soul (4)

Sigil 6: Flask (7)

Sigil 7: Mask (6)

Sigil 8: Hurr (9)

Sigil 9: Shield (10)

Sigil 10: Misalogus (8)
