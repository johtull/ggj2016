But Skygods have no favor to place one within, and his prayers went unanswered.”

Upon his victory, Tr'a ascended into demon-hood, and led Mankind astray.”

For that is its own reward."

May the word of Skygods spur you to live according to their laws every day, for you never know when the last day shall come."

Devout One
Whom wields thy faith as a crutch.

Be free,
Through me,
And forge new chains
Among the prayers of old.”
