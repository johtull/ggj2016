Good ending: Player successfully completed all rituals

Screen of a demon or something being locked away in a vessel (like a vase? Idk have fun with it) by the robed protagonist. You Did It!


Bad Ending: Player fucked up somewhere along the way

Screen of a demon or something in full form just destroying the protagonist, or maybe just an image of earth on fire and devastated. Game Over.
