Sigil Descriptions

Sigil 1: The Key

A symbol of creation, failure, destruction, and rebirth. Its meaning is emblematic of the covenant between the cultists and their gods.

Sigil 2: Auger of Tr'a

A relic from the days of the Fall of Man in the Ancient Texts, the Auger was the tool of Tr'a while he was still mortal. A symbol of his subservience that became the instrument of defiance.

Sigil 3: Skygods' Blade

Blessed with the divine retribution of Skygods, this blade was used during the Fall of Man to render Tr'a from his mortal form and banish him from this world. How it's ended up here is anyone's guess. 

Sigil 4: Sanguine Pearl

A mystic gem that contains the crystalized blood of Tr'a himself. A mysterious relic that is revered by many who revel in this cult.

Sigil 5: Soul Pearl

A mystic gem that is said to contain the spiritual essence of Tr'a. A strange relic that is feared by even his worshipers.

Sigil 6: Flask

A vial filled with a viscous fluid, unknown in origin, but reeks of torpor and fate.

Sigil 7: Guide Defiled

A deformed and scorned effigy of the Pearl Mask of The Guide, sent to deliver Mankind toward their salvation. This accursed version is an insult to all who hold true to the Teachings and should be destroyed immediately.

Sigil 8: Hurr's Embrace

Envoking the true name of the wisest of the world can bring forth much pain. Holding any depiction likewise leaves your hands feeling unclean.

Sigil 9: Aegis of Condor

The retribution, sent from Skygods, carried this shield into the final battle with Tr'a that ended in his imprisonment. It is only fitting that it should reappear in this dark hour.

Sigil 10: The Misalogus

The holy writ of Skygods, divinely inspired to Mankind. Its pages seep with understanding for those who walk the path.
